/**
 * Provides a method of interacting with events using a string key.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is "the place" to go to schedule asynchronous events. There's a few things you
 * should definitely make note of here.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>These won't run if the robot freezes.</li>
 *     <li>If the robot lags, these will too.</li>
 *     <li>Scheduling a ton of async events (more than 400 per string) will crash.</li>
 *     <li>This doesn't run on a separate thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Rather than using Java's built-in async functionality, I'm using a bit of a custom
 * extension of that. My reasoning behind it isn't exactly all that important. You can
 * still go right ahead and use the async functionality Java provides for you - actually,
 * me.wobblyyyy.ftc2.utils.async.tasks includes two classes which allow you to easily schedule
 * both repeating and non-repeating classes. However, that's not the point here. The point
 * is that you're this far into this class, and you're probably reading this because you
 * want to use it. Go on, do it.

     * String represents a STRING key for the event scheduler,

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In general, you'll only want to assign one event, whether
     * repeating or not, to each string / key. This makes it so you
     * can easily schedule and then cancel events, even if
     * they're repeating.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you follow this practice of only assigning a single event to
     * each key, you'll never have to worry about any overlaps caused by
     * key deletion. A reason you might NOT want to follow this guideline
     * is if you have several events which should run non-stop and are
     * all part of the same functionality. If you have a set of 4 repeating
     * events which are supposed to run at the same time, putting them all
     * under a single key makes it easy to stop them all at once.

     * <p>
     * This can be a processing-power consuming operation. Ticking every

     * HashMaps. Ideally, this should be done every run cycle in order to

     * If the delay is anything other than zero, create a new
     * scheduled event, with a duration of however long the
     * delay is. Once that event expires and the close method
     * is run, schedule another event, with the actual duration
     * and the actual event included.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * If the delay IS zero, however, calculate the expiration
     * date of the event and schedule an event for that long.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Don't worry if this doesn't make any sense - this
     * method will handle any confusion you have and just so perfectly
     * schedule everything nicely for you.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * In general, when scheduling an event, you're going to use
     * the open and close methods contained within Timed.
     * *** MAKE SURE NOT TO FORGET TO STOP ANYTHING ***
     * ***   YOU NEED TO STOP IN THE CLOSE METHOD!  ***
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Although it might be a little bit annoying, the code
     * to schedule a timed event is a lot longer. This is mostly
     * because every timed event actually has to spawn two events
     * with slightly different expiration dates. And not only that,
     * but because 'ran' is a boolean stored in the Timed element,
     * it has to be manually set to false every single time, which
     * is why I clone the original timed and set the value to false.
     * If you're reading this and you have a better method of doing
     * this, please let me know, I'd much rather not have this poorly
     * written code just lying here.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param name         the string name of the event scheduler you'd like to access.
     *                     It's often a wise idea to store this sting in a variable so you
     *                     can easily access said string and thus easily access
     *                     said event.
     * @param duration     how long the event should last, in milliseconds. Repeating events
     *                     will re-schedule themselves during the "close" portion of this
     *                     duration (at the very end) and regular events will execute normally.
     * @param delay        the delay before the event takes place. The delay will only ever
     *                     have an effect on non-repeating events. If you'd like to modify the
     *                     duration between executions of a repeating event, change the "duration."
     * @param timed        the actual timed element which should be executed. Timed elements are
     *                     fairly complex, so I'd suggest you go check out {@link Timed}.
     * @param shouldRepeat whether or not the event should repeat itself. Repeating events are not
     *                     affected by delay. Additionally, repeating events schedule two separate
     *                     events - one to schedule another execution, and one to actually handle
     *                     the execution of the Timed you've provided.
