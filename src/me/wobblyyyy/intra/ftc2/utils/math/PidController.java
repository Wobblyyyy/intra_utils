/**
 * A class used in representing a proportional-integral-derivative
 * virtual controller.
 *
 * <p>
 * The code for this {@code PidController} is based off code from the wpilib
 * project, which I did not contribute to. None of the code here is copied
 * line-for-line, rather, the general structure and functionality of this
 * class generally mimics that of the wpilib {@code PidController}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * PID controllers can sometimes be rather difficult to understand - I know
 * for a fact I didn't understand a thing about them when I first starting
 * using them in code. In order to (hopefully) help make this process at least
 * a bit easier for you, if you're not acquainted with PID controllers, here's
 * a brief collection of resources that might be helpful.

 *
 * <p>
 * The balance of these effects is achieved by loop tuning to produce the
 * optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as "K" and
 * must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response
 * characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are
 * dependent on the behavior of the measuring sensor, the final control element
 * (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself.
 * Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the
 * type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by "bumping"
 * the process in practice by introducing a setpoint change and observing
 * the system response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee optimal control of the
 * system or its control stability. Situations may occur where there are
 * excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the
 * control action does not apply quickly enough. In these cases leadâ€“lag
 * compensation is required to be effective. The response of the controller
 * can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to
 * which the system overshoots a setpoint, and the degree of any system
 * oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable since it relies
 * only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge
 * or a model of the underlying process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Many PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical
 * maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the
 * form of either stiction or backlash in the mechanical response to an input
 * signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a
 * device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern,
 * the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of
 * activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the
 * controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within
 * the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband
 * before the actual output will change.

     * The obvious method is proportional control: the motor current is set in
     * proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for
     * instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight
     * needs a greater force applied for the same error on the down side,

     * Term P is proportional to the current value of the SP-PV error e(t). For
     * example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will be
     * proportionately large and positive, taking into account the gain factor
     * "K". Using proportional control alone will result in an error between
     * the setpoint and the actual process value because it requires an error
     * to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there
     * is no corrective response.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * A high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a
     * given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the
     * system can become unstable (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast,
     * a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error,
     * and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional
     * gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to
     * system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that
     * the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.

     * An integral term increases action in relation not only to the error but
     * also the time for which it has persisted. So, if the applied force is
     * not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as
     * time passes. A pure "I" controller could bring the error to zero, but
     * it would be both slow reacting at the start (because the action would be
     * small at the beginning, needing time to get significant) and brutal (the
     * action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has
     * started to approach zero).
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Term I accounts for past values of the SP-PV error and integrates them
     * over time to produce the I term. For example, if there is a residual
     * SP-PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral
     * term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect
     * due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is
     * eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result
     * in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases,
     * but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards
     * setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs
     * with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term
     * responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present
     * value to overshoot the setpoint value (see the section on loop tuning).

     * it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint),
     * but the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It
     * aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping
     * the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side
     * because of too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the
     * error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting,
     * if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite
     * direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output
     * would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or
     * decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increases with
     * time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable.
